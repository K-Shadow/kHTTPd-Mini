INTRODUCTION
------------
kHTTPd Mini is a web server written in Python, for situations when you don't need a full featured web server.
I also wrote this to learn more about the HTTP protocol.

INSTALLATION
------------
kHTTPd Mini uses the Twisted library for handling network connections, so you must have it installed to use kHTTPd Mini.
Simply edit the khttpd.conf file, and place your files in the directory you specified in khttpd.conf, and run khttpd.py!
